  <p> <i>"You can always tell when a person has worked in a restaurant.
     There’s an empathy that can only be cultivated by those who’ve stood between
      a hungry mouth and a $28 pork chop,
      a special understanding of the way a bunch of motley misfits can be a family.
      Service industry work develops the “soft skills” recruiters talk about on LinkedIn
      — discipline, promptness, the ability to absorb criticism, and most important,
      how to read people like a book. The work is thankless and fun and messy,
      and the world would be a kinder place if more people tried it.
      With all due respect to my former professors,
      I’ve long believed I gained more knowledge in kitchens,
      bars, and dining rooms than any college could even hold" - Anthony Bourdain.</i></p>
